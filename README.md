In this project, i explored and build time series forecasting model for measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
the data set was provided by Hamoye where i did my internship as a test of our time-series analysis skill.
the data contains 92016 entries and 5 columns which consists of FullDate, Tmax,	SysLoad,	GasPrice and ElecPrice as column names.
Apart from the FullDate column, every other column is of thr float data type
