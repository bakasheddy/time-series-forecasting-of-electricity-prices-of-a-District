This data set was provided by Hamoye where i did my internship as a test of our time-series analysis skill.
the data contains 92016 entries and 5 columns which consists of FullDate, Tmax,	SysLoad,	GasPrice and ElecPrice as column names.
the dataset captures the power consumption of a building for a period of 11 years (2010 - 2021

Apart from the FullDate column, every other column is of thr float data type, the FullDate column was converted from object(string) to datetime format before exploration

## Aim

In this project, i will explore and build time series forecasting model for measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.

## Objective

To achieve what i aim for, i used Facebook's prophet to build my model and train it on 9 years of the dataset (2010 - 2019), the testing data will be done on the two remaining years
